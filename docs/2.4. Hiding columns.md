# HPU DataGrid Module - Hiding columns
One of the core features of the DataGrid is allowing your users to select the data they want to show.
But with great flexibility comes some responsibility. You can imagine when listing data of system users, the password columns must remain hidden.
Luckily hiding specific fields can be really easy when configuring the DataGrid.

## Hiding a column
Hiding columns is done by defining them in a configuration array. Take a look at the example below where the password fields form a
user and his associated creator are hidden. 
    
    'wms-datagrid' => array(
        'Application\Controller\Index' => array(
            'entityName' => 'ZfcUser\Entity\User',
            'defaultColumns' => array(
                'username', 'email', 'displayName', 'state'
            ),
            'prohibitedColumns' => array (
                'password', 'creator.password'
            ),
        ),
    );
