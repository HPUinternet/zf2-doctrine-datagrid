# HPU DataGrid Module - Contributing
Any help with the module is appreciated!
If you've found a bug or need a feature, feel free to create an issue (or even better: a Pull Request).

For development we are using the [Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
If you're adding or chaining core features, unit tests are mandatory to ensure stability of the module.

If you enjoy using the module, please spread the word.
